# Why Untested Infrastructure is Broken Infrastructure: A GitHub Actions Journey

Countless production outages are caused by lack of testing: **infrastructure that isn't tested is broken until proven otherwise**.

Managing infrastructures using Terraform may seem to work after a successful `terraform apply` but more often than not, it is risky without proper testing. Automated testing often uncovers hidden issues that can cause production outages. Some of the issues I discovered during testing a sample lambda module are:

- **modules** with configuration drift issues
- **Security groups** misconfigurations
- **Lambda functions** failing to deploy properly in specific VPC configurations
- **Environment variables** corrupted during deployments

To ensure a reliable infrastructure code, a comprehensive testing strategy is required.

## Implementation

Here is an excerpt of a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically tests every component of the infrastructure code.
The GitHub Actions workflow implements 3 testing categories and each test runs in parallel to reduce feedback loop.

```yaml
name: VPC Lambda Tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: validate
    if: needs.validate.outputs.should_run_tests == 'true' && (github.event.inputs.test_category == 'all' || github.event.inputs.test_category == 'vpc' || github.event.inputs.test_category == '')
    strategy:
      matrix:
        test_case:
          - TestLambdaVPCIntegration
          - TestLambdaVPCWithMultipleSubnets
          - TestLambdaVPCSecurityGroupRules      
```

### AWS Resource Testing

Unlike synthetic tests, this approach creates **AWS resources** during testing. Here's an example of the implementation:

```go
func TestLambdaBasicPython(t *testing.T) {
    // Generate unique names for resources
    uniqueID := random.UniqueId()
    functionName := fmt.Sprintf("test-lambda-basic-python-%s", uniqueID)
    
    // Terraform options
    terraformOptions := terraform.WithDefaultRetryableErrors(t, &terraform.Options{
        TerraformDir: "../examples/lambda-basic-python",
        Vars: map[string]interface{}{
            "function_name": functionName,
            "aws_region":    awsRegion,
        },
    })
    
    // Clean up resources with "terraform destroy" at the end
    defer terraform.Destroy(t, terraformOptions)
    
    // Run "terraform init" and "terraform apply"
    terraform.InitAndApply(t, terraformOptions)
    
    // Verify Lambda function exists and invoke it
    lambdaClient := aws.NewLambdaClient(t, awsRegion)
    invokeResult, err := lambdaClient.Invoke(&lambda.InvokeInput{
        FunctionName: awssdk.String(functionName),
        Payload:      []byte(`{"test": "data"}`),
    })
    require.NoError(t, err)
    assert.Equal(t, int64(200), *invokeResult.StatusCode)
}
```

### Test Coverage

The testing framework covers the following aspects for demo purposes:

- **Basic functionality**: Does the infrastructure actually work?
- **VPC integration**: Can Lambda functions communicate properly within VPCs?
- **Security configurations**: Are security groups configured correctly?
- **Performance benchmarks**: Does deployment complete within acceptable timeframes?
- **Environment variables**: Do configurations pass through properly?
- **Cleanup procedures**: Are resources properly destroyed?

### Resource Management

Every test should include automatic cleanup:

```yaml
cleanup:
  name: Cleanup Resources
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: [test-basic, test-vpc, test-integration, test-performance]
  if: always() && needs.validate.outputs.should_run_tests == 'true'
  steps:
    - name: Cleanup test resources
      run: |
        # Clean up Lambda functions with test prefix
        aws lambda list-functions --query 'Functions[?starts_with(FunctionName, `test-lambda`)].FunctionName' --output text | \
        xargs -r -n1 aws lambda delete-function --function-name || true
```

## Results

- **Decreased Production incidents**
This enables everyone on the team to deploy infrastructure changes with confidence, because the tests catch issues before they become problems. 
- **Increase in Deployment confidence**
No more crossing fingers during deployments means less time spent debugging and more time spent building.
- **Cost Optimisation**
Catching security misconfigurations to prevent breaches is now automated.
Significant cost optimization by catching issues in testing.

## Conclusion
Like any other code, Infrastructure code that is not tested is bound to have bugs. The question isn't whether infrastructure code should be testedâ€”it's whether we can afford not to. There's no going back once you experience the peace of mind that comes with truly tested infrastructure.
