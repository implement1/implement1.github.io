## Architecture Overview

The Jenkins server implementation follows a modular, security-first approach that combines multiple AWS services to create a scalable and resilient CI/CD infrastructure:

```
Internet → ALB (SSL Termination) → Target Group → Auto Scaling Group → Jenkins Instance (Private) → EBS Volumes (Encrypted)
```

### Core Components

**Auto Scaling Group**: Single-instance configuration with automatic recovery capabilities for cost-effective high availability.

**Application Load Balancer**: SSL termination and traffic distribution while maintaining private instance placement.

**EBS Storage**: Dedicated encrypted volumes for Jenkins data persistence and compliance requirements.

**Security Groups**: Multi-layer security controls for network traffic isolation and access management.

## Key Features and Implementation

### Auto Scaling Group Integration
```hcl
module "jenkins_server_asg" {
  source = "./jenkins-aws"
  
  instance_type = var.instance_type
  min_size = 1
  max_size = 1
  desired_capacity = 1
  health_check_type = "ELB"
  health_check_grace_period = var.health_check_grace_period
}
```

This approach provides several benefits:
- **Automatic Recovery**: ELB health checks ensure failed instances are replaced
- **Cost Efficiency**: Single-instance design minimizes infrastructure costs
- **High Availability**: ASG ensures service continuity during failures

### Application Load Balancer Configuration
```hcl
module "alb" {
  source = "./alb-aws"
  
  is_internal_alb = true
  ssl_policy = var.ssl_policy
  certificate_domain_name = var.domain_name
}
```

This configuration provides:
- **SSL Termination**: Centralized certificate management and encryption
- **Private Networking**: Jenkins instances remain in private subnets
- **Load Distribution**: Ready for multi-instance scaling when needed

## Security Implementation

Security forms the foundation of this Jenkins deployment with multiple layers of protection:

#### Network Security
- **Private Instance Placement**: Jenkins instances receive no public IP addresses
- **Internal ALB Configuration**: Load balancer operates within the VPC boundary
- **Security Group Isolation**: Controlled traffic flow between ALB and Jenkins instances
- **CIDR-Based Access Control**: Configurable source IP restrictions

#### Encryption at Rest
```hcl
resource "aws_ebs_volume" "jenkins_data" {
  encrypted = true
  kms_key_id = var.kms_id
  size = var.ebs_volume_size
}
```

Both root and additional EBS volumes implement encryption by default, ensuring data protection for Jenkins configurations, build artifacts, and logs.

#### SSL/TLS Configuration
The implementation supports SSL policies with configurable certificate management:
- **Default SSL Policy**: ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS-1-1-2017-01
- **ACM Integration**: Automatic certificate validation and renewal
- **HTTPS Redirection**: Optional HTTP to HTTPS traffic redirection

## High Availability Design

Despite using a single instance configuration, the implementation incorporates several high availability features:

#### Automatic Recovery
```hcl
target_group_arns = [aws_lb_target_group.jenkins_target_group.arn]
health_check_type = "ELB"
health_check_grace_period = var.health_check_grace_period
```

The Auto Scaling Group monitors instance health through ELB health checks and automatically replaces failed instances, ensuring minimal downtime.

#### Graceful Deployment
- **Batch Deployment**: Controlled instance replacement during updates
- **Deregistration Delays**: Configurable target group deregistration for in-flight request completion
- **Health Check Validation**: Multiple health check attempts before marking instances as healthy

## Configuration Management

The implementation provides extensive customization through 64 configurable variables covering all aspects of the deployment:

#### Infrastructure Variables
```hcl
variable "instance_type" {
  description = "The Jenkins server instance type"
  type = string
  default = "t2.micro"
}

variable "jenkins_port" {
  description = "The Jenkins server port"
  type = number
  default = 8080
}
```

#### Operational Variables
- **Health Check Parameters**: Intervals, thresholds, timeouts
- **Deployment Configuration**: Batch sizes, update policies
- **Storage Options**: Volume sizes, encryption settings, snapshot sources
- **Network Settings**: VPC, subnet, security group configurations

## Storage and Encryption

The storage architecture supports both development and production workloads:

#### EBS Volume Configuration
```hcl
ebs_block_device {
  device_name = "/dev/sda"
  volume_type = var.ebs_type
  volume_size = var.ebs_size
  encrypted = var.ebs_encrypted
  iops = var.ebs_iops
}
```

#### Storage Features
- **Dedicated Data Volume**: Separate 100GB EBS volume for Jenkins data
- **Snapshot Support**: Optional snapshot-based volume creation for data recovery
- **Performance Optimization**: Configurable IOPS for high-performance workloads
- **Encryption**: KMS-based encryption for compliance requirements

## Load Balancing and SSL Termination

The Application Load Balancer provides sophisticated traffic management:

#### Target Group Configuration
```hcl
resource "aws_lb_target_group" "jenkins_target_group" {
  name = "${var.name_prefix}-jenkins-tg"
  port = var.jenkins_port
  protocol = "HTTP"
  vpc_id = data.aws_vpc.default.id
  
  health_check {
    enabled = true
    healthy_threshold = var.alb_healthy_threshold
    interval = var.alb_health_check_interval
    matcher = "200"
    path = var.alb_health_check_path
    port = "traffic-port"
    protocol = "HTTP"
    timeout = var.alb_health_check_timeout
    unhealthy_threshold = var.alb_unhealthy_threshold
  }
}
```

#### Advanced Health Checking
- **Custom Health Check Path**: `/login` endpoint monitoring
- **Configurable Thresholds**: 2 healthy/10 unhealthy checks by default
- **Flexible Intervals**: 15-second health check intervals
- **HTTP 200 Validation**: Ensures Jenkins application is responding correctly

## DNS Integration and Domain Management

Optional Route53 integration provides custom domain support:

#### DNS Configuration
```hcl
resource "aws_route53_record" "jenkins_dns" {
  count = var.create_route53_entry ? 1 : 0
  zone_id = var.hosted_zone_id
  name = var.domain_name
  type = "A"
  
  alias {
    name = module.alb.alb_dns_name
    zone_id = module.alb.alb_zone_id
    evaluate_target_health = true
  }
}
```

This enables domain names for Jenkins instances while maintaining automatic failover capabilities.

## Monitoring and Health Checks

Detailed monitoring ensures operational visibility:

#### Multi-Layer Health Checks
- **ALB Health Checks**: Application-level monitoring via `/login` endpoint
- **ASG Health Checks**: Instance-level monitoring through ELB integration
- **CloudWatch Integration**: Automatic metric collection and alarming capabilities

#### Operational Logging
```hcl
variable "script_log_level" {
  description = "Log level for deployment scripts"
  type = string
  default = "INFO"
}
```

Configurable logging levels support troubleshooting and operational monitoring.

## Production-Ready Features

Several features distinguish this implementation as production-grade:

#### Security Hardening
- **No Public IP Assignment**: Instances remain in private subnets
- **Encryption by Default**: All storage encrypted with customer-managed keys
- **SSL Enforcement**: TLS policies with optional HTTPS redirection

#### Operational Excellence
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Complete Terraform automation
- **Modular Design**: Reusable components through external Git modules
- **Configuration Management**: Extensive variable-based customization
- **Deployment Safety**: Controlled rollouts with health verification

## Cost Optimization Strategies

The implementation balances functionality with cost considerations:

#### Development Environment Optimization
- **t2.micro Default**: Cost-effective instance type for development
- **Single Instance**: Minimal infrastructure footprint
- **Optional Features**: DNS and SSL features can be disabled for testing

#### Production Scaling
- **Instance Type Flexibility**: Easy scaling to larger instance types
- **Storage Optimization**: Configurable volume sizes and performance
- **Resource Tagging**: Cost allocation and management support

## Deployment and Operational Considerations

#### Deployment Process
```hcl
variable "batch_size" {
  description = "Rolling deployments size"
  type = number
  default = 1
}
```

Controlled deployment process ensures zero-downtime updates and rollback capabilities.

#### Maintenance Operations
- **Skip Health Checks**: Optional health check bypass for maintenance
- **Graceful Shutdowns**: Configurable deregistration delays
- **Backup Integration**: Snapshot-based backup and recovery support
