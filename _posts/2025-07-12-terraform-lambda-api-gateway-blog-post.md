# Building Production-Ready HTTP APIs with Terraform, AWS Lambda and API Gateway

Combining AWS Lambda with API Gateway has become the gold standard for building scalable HTTP APIs. We'll explore a Terraform configuration that demonstrates how to build production-ready serverless APIs with proper logging, monitoring, and security controls.

## The Challenge: Beyond Basic Serverless

While AWS makes it relatively straightforward to create a simple Lambda function and API Gateway, production deployments require additional considerations:

- **Comprehensive logging and monitoring**
- **Custom domain support with SSL certificates**
- **CORS configuration for web applications**
- **Proper IAM policies and security controls**
- **Routing for multiple endpoints**
- **Infrastructure as Code for reproducibility**

## Architecture Overview

The configuration creates a complete serverless HTTP API infrastructure using these key components:

```
Internet → Route 53 (optional) → API Gateway V2 → Lambda Functions → CloudWatch Logs
```

### Core Components

**API Gateway V2 (HTTP API)**: The module uses the newer HTTP API (not REST API) which offers better performance, lower latency, and reduced costs—up to 70% cheaper than REST API.

**Lambda Integration**: Uses AWS_PROXY integration for request/response handling between API Gateway and Lambda functions.

**CloudWatch Logging**: Access logging with multiple format options (JSON, CLF, or custom).

**Custom Domain Support**: Integration with Route 53 and ACM certificates for domain management.

## Key Features and Implementation

### Route Configuration

The standout feature is the flexible route configuration:

```hcl
route_config = {
  "GET /users" = {
    lambda_function_arn = "arn:aws:lambda:..."
    description = "Get users endpoint"
    payload_format_version = "2.0"
    timeout_milliseconds = 29000
  }
  "POST /users" = {
    lambda_function_arn = "arn:aws:lambda:..."
    description = "Create user endpoint"
  }
  "PUT /users/{id}" = {
    lambda_function_arn = "arn:aws:lambda:..."
    description = "Update user endpoint"
  }
}
```

This approach provides several benefits:
- **Simple Syntax**: HTTP method and path combined in a single key
- **Per-Route Configuration**: Each route can have specific settings
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Easy to add or remove endpoints

### Intelligent Route Processing

This includes logic to parse route keys:

```hcl
locals {
  route_key_split = {
    for route_key, _ in var.route_config :
    route_key => {
      method = split(" ", route_key)[0]  # Extract HTTP method
      path   = split(" ", route_key)[1]  # Extract path
    }
  }
}
```

This parsing enables the configuration to automatically:
- Extract HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Parse API paths including path parameters
- Create appropriate API Gateway routes and integrations

### Production-Ready Logging

The module offers three logging formats:

**JSON Format** (recommended for production):
```json
{
  "requestId": "$context.requestId",
  "extendedRequestId": "$context.extendedRequestId",
  "ip": "$context.identity.sourceIp",
  "caller": "$context.identity.caller",
  "user": "$context.identity.user",
  "requestTime": "$context.requestTime",
  "httpMethod": "$context.httpMethod",
  "resourcePath": "$context.resourcePath",
  "status": "$context.status",
  "protocol": "$context.protocol",
  "responseLength": "$context.responseLength"
}
```

**Common Log Format** (CLF) for web server compatibility:
```
$context.identity.sourceIp - - [$context.requestTime] "$context.httpMethod $context.resourcePath $context.protocol" $context.status $context.responseLength
```

### CORS Configuration

Built-in CORS support for web applications:

```hcl
cors_configuration = {
  allow_credentials = true
  allow_headers = ["content-type", "x-amz-date", "authorization"]
  allow_methods = ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"]
  allow_origins = ["https://example.com", "https://app.example.com"]
  max_age = 86400
}
```

### Custom Domain Integration

This configuration integrates with Route 53 and ACM:

```hcl
module "api_gateway" {
  source = "./lambda-http-api-gateway"
  
  name = "production-api"
  
  # Custom domain configuration
  create_route53_entry = true
  domain_name = "api.example.com"
  hosted_zone_id = "Z123456789"
  
  # SSL certificate (managed by ACM)
  certificate_arn = "arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:123456789012:certificate/..."
  
  route_config = {
    "GET /api/users" = {
      lambda_function_arn = aws_lambda_function.get_users.arn
    }
  }
}
```

## Security and Best Practices

### IAM Permissions

Creating least-privilege IAM policies:

```hcl
resource "aws_lambda_permission" "api_gateway_invoke" {
  for_each = var.route_config

  statement_id  = "AllowExecutionFromAPIGateway"
  action        = "lambda:InvokeFunction"
  function_name = each.value.lambda_function_arn
  principal     = "apigateway.amazonaws.com"
  source_arn    = "${aws_apigatewayv2_api.this.execution_arn}/*/*"
}
```

### Encryption

CloudWatch logs are encrypted with customer-managed KMS keys:

```hcl
resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_group" "api_gateway_access_logs" {
  name              = var.access_log_cloudwatch_log_group_name
  retention_in_days = var.access_log_retention_in_days
  kms_key_id        = var.access_log_kms_key_id
}
```

### Regional Endpoints

Uses TLS 1.2 and regional endpoints for better performance and security:

```hcl
resource "aws_apigatewayv2_domain_name" "this" {
  domain_name = var.domain_name
  
  domain_name_configuration {
    certificate_arn = data.aws_acm_certificate.this[0].arn
    endpoint_type   = "REGIONAL"
    security_policy = "TLS_1_2"
  }
}
```

## Real-World Usage Example

Here's how it might be implemented in a production environment:

```hcl
module "user_api" {
  source = "./lambda-http-api-gateway"
  
  name        = "user-management-api"
  description = "User management API for mobile app"
  
  route_config = {
    "GET /users" = {
      lambda_function_arn = aws_lambda_function.list_users.arn
      description = "List all users"
      payload_format_version = "2.0"
    }
    "GET /users/{id}" = {
      lambda_function_arn = aws_lambda_function.get_user.arn
      description = "Get user by ID"
      payload_format_version = "2.0"
    }
    "POST /users" = {
      lambda_function_arn = aws_lambda_function.create_user.arn
      description = "Create new user"
      payload_format_version = "2.0"
    }
    "PUT /users/{id}" = {
      lambda_function_arn = aws_lambda_function.update_user.arn
      description = "Update user"
      payload_format_version = "2.0"
    }
    "DELETE /users/{id}" = {
      lambda_function_arn = aws_lambda_function.delete_user.arn
      description = "Delete user"
      payload_format_version = "2.0"
    }
  }
  
  # Production domain configuration
  create_route53_entry = true
  domain_name = "api.myapp.com"
  hosted_zone_id = data.aws_route53_zone.main.zone_id
  
  # CORS for web app
  cors_configuration = {
    allow_credentials = true
    allow_headers = ["content-type", "authorization"]
    allow_methods = ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"]
    allow_origins = ["https://myapp.com"]
    max_age = 86400
  }
  
  # Enhanced logging
  access_log_cloudwatch_log_group_name = "/aws/apigateway/user-api"
  access_log_format_type = "JSON"
  access_log_retention_in_days = 30
  
  # Log forwarding to central logging
  access_log_cloudwatch_log_subscription_filter_name = "user-api-logs"
  access_log_cloudwatch_log_subscription_filter_log_group_destination = "/aws/lambda/log-processor"
  
  tags = {
    Environment = "production"
    Team        = "backend"
    Project     = "user-management"
  }
}
```

## Monitoring and Observability

The configuration exposes outputs for monitoring:

```hcl
output "api_endpoint" {
  value = module.user_api.api_endpoint
}

output "cloudwatch_log_group" {
  value = module.user_api.access_log_cloudwatch_log_group_name
}
```

These outputs can be used to create CloudWatch dashboards, alarms, and integrate with monitoring tools like Datadog or New Relic.

## Benefits of This Approach

### 1. **Reusability**
This can be used across multiple projects and environments with minimal configuration changes.

### 2. **Scalability**
Adding new endpoints is as simple as adding entries to the `route_config` map.

### 3. **Maintainability**
All infrastructure is defined in code, making it easy to version, review, and rollback.

### 4. **Security**
Built-in security best practices including proper IAM policies, encryption, and TLS configuration.

### 5. **Cost Optimization**
Uses HTTP API instead of REST API for cost savings.

## Considerations and Limitations

### Cold Starts
Lambda functions may experience cold starts. Consider using provisioned concurrency for critical endpoints.

### Payload Size Limits
API Gateway has a 10MB payload limit. For larger payloads, using presigned URLs for direct S3 uploads is a better choice.

### Timeout Limits
API Gateway has a 30-second timeout limit. For longer-running operations, asynchronous processing patterns is advised.

## Conclusion

This post demonstrates how to build production-ready serverless APIs that go beyond basic tutorials. By combining AWS Lambda with API Gateway V2, proper logging, custom domains, and security controls, we can create maintainable APIs that are ready for production workloads.

This approach makes it easy to standardize API deployment across organizations while maintaining the flexibility to customize for specific use cases. This pattern provides a solid foundation for serverless development when building simple REST APIs or complex microservices architectures.
